        <p>
            My name is Justin Park, and I am currently an MBA student at California
            State University, Fullerton (CSUF). Prior to graduate school, I attended
            the University of California, Irvine (UCI) where I received my B.S. degree
            in Mechanical Engineering.<br></br>I am currently working as a Program Management
            Intern at GKN Aerospace located in Garden Grove, CA. My roles include revenue management,
            forecasting & budget analysis, market analysis, and lifecycle gate management.
            I take pride in supporting executive decision making with the use of business analytics and business
            development.<br></br>At UCI I was a part of the Kababayan Club
            where they hosted a multitude of social events, workshops, study sessions,
            and performance shows. I also enjoyed participating in the intramural sports
            league at UCI which included both basketball and flag football. During my
            time in college, I worked a few years in customer service as a server/cook
            at the restaurant Tender Greens located at the Irvine Spectrum. During my
            free time I enjoy playing the guitar, watching/playing basketball, and
            listening to music.
